                            The point of this app is to show in a fun, visual way, how long it would take you to buy things.
                            And to compare that time to, say, <i>how long it would take Elon Musk or whoever rich folk to buy the same thing</i>.

                            While not always accurate, this demonstration usually leads to important questions like <i>"How
                            the fuck can these guys have this much money?"</i>, <i>"Will I ever be able to buy a house?"</i>
                            or even <i>"Who should I contact to buy a 65 m Yacht right now?"</i>.

                            Let me get this straight: the point is definitely not to be perfectly accurate. The arguments
                            saying that Musk's indecent fortune shouldn't be compared to a wage, that only tethered to the
                            value of his companies or whatever, <u>are misleading and empty</u>. What matters is that these people
                            have access to infinitely more than the rest of us, and that we will never, ever catch up.
