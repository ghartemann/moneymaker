                            The purpose of this app is to show in a visual and engaging way the stark contrast in
                            purchasing power between the average person and the ultra-rich, such as, say, Elon Musk.
                            By comparing the time it takes for an average wage earner to afford everyday items to the
                            time it takes for a billionaire, the app highlights the vast economic disparities in our
                            society.

                            While the calculations may not always be precise, the demonstrations are designed to raise
                            important questions. Questions like,
                            <i>"How the fuck did these guys end up with so much money?"</i>,
                            <i>"Will I ever be able to buy a house in this market?"</i>
                            or even <i>"Who should I contact to buy a 65 m Yacht right now?"</i>.

                            Let's be clear: the goal is not to achieve perfect accuracy. One might â€” and undeniably will
                            â€” argue that comparing Musk's fortune to an average wage is misleading because his wealth is
                            tied to the value of his companies. While mostly true, this argument misses the point; the
                            crucial issue is that
                            <strong>
                                the ultra-wealthy have access to resources and opportunities that are orders of magnitude
                                greater than what the rest of us can ever hope to attain.
                            </strong>
                            This disparity should prompt us to question the fairness and sustainability of our economic
                            systems, if anything.
