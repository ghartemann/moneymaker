                "While not always accurate, this demonstration usually leads to important questions like <i>\"Howthe fuck can these guys have this much money?\"</i>, <i>\"Will I ever be able to buy a house?\"</i>or even <i>\"Who should I contact to buy a 65 m Yacht right now?\"</i>.",
                "Let me get this straight: the point is definitely not to be perfectly accurate. The arguments saying that Musk's indecent fortune shouldn't be compared to a wage, that it is only dependant on the value of his companies or whatever, <u>are misleading and empty</u>. What matters is that these people have access to infinitely more than the rest of us, and that we will never, ever catch up.",
